# Middle Mouse Button Scroll

Scroll fast through long documents with middle-click scroll.

Pressing `Alt`, `Ctrl` or `Shift` key when using the mouse button enables you to use the browser's implementation of middle-click scroll.

**Note**: For now the extension scrolls only the whole page and not different parts of it. If you are unable to scroll given page that's the reason why. That feature is planned.
